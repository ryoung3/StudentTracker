# StudentTracker
Student Tracker spring web application

This neat little spring based app is my attempt at building a student tracking web app. 
This web app allows you to add, delete, and update a student and their information.
Check out the screenshots below for a qucik look at the interface.

<h3> Tech Specs </h3>
<p>I used the Spring Tool Suite to build this project.
</br>
I used Maven to handle all of my dependencies.
</br>
My server of choice was Apache Tomcat 8.
</br>
The database table was created using the mySQL and I'd occasionally test that my queries were working correctly using mySQL Workbench.
</br>
For the ORM I used Hibernate.

<h3> Lessons &amp Future work</h3>
<p>I need more practice working with the Spring Framework, so I signed up for a Udemy course and learned enough Sping to build this handy little web app. Of course I learned alot about the spring framework like creating and managing controllers, working with a persistence layer, gathering and managing form data from a web page, developing using the DAO pattern and how to use an ORM to make working with a database much easier. 
In the future I'm going to add a calendar to this app that allows a user to track a students attendance. I'd also like to add more information about the student like their grade, grade point average, &amp age. I'm probably going to reconstruct the front-end using either Angualar or React (I still haven't decided yet). I'm looking forward to the changes I'll implement in the future.
As always feel free to edit this code as you'd like.
